# C-Programming
A repository of bunch of C projects such as RLE String Compression, LinkedLists, Binary Search Trees, etc.

1. BST: Allows for various functionalities with a Binary Search Tree structure:

--> Insertion: Insert an integer value into the BST (Inserted in a sorted arragnement).

--> Deletion: Delete an integer value from the BST (Sorted arrangement is adjusted)

--> Search: Search for a specific value in the BST.

--> Print BST: Print out the entire BST with a parenthesis-included syntax.

2. List: Allows for various functionalities with a Linked List structure:

--> Insertion: Insert an integer value into the LL (Inserted in a sorted arrangement).

--> Deletion: Delete an integer value from the LL (Sorted arrangement is adjusted).

--> Print LL: Print out the entire LL in a sorted manner.

3. MEXP: An iterative pproach to 'Matrix Exponentiation'. The method takes in a file pointer, where the file has a specified syntax which contains 1) The input matrix, 2) The power 'n', which exponentiates the given matrix to an 'n'th power.

4. Palindrome: Checks if the input string is a palindrome or not. Includes additional error-handling such as:

--> Case #1 = Strings with spaces: "race car"

--> Case #2 = Strings with uppercase letters: "Racecar"

5. RLE String Compression: Compresses the input string to a --> 'character''count' format and returns the string with the lesser length:

--> Input: "sssd", Output: "s3d"

--> Input: "asd", Output: "asd"

6. Roman: Converts any given integer value to the equivalent Roman Numeral:

--> Input: "9", Output: "IX"

--> Input: "1991", Output: "MCMXCI"
